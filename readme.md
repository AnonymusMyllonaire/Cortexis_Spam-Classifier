## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocess SMS text (lowercasing, stopword removal, punctuation removal, tokenization).
- Convert text into **TF-IDF vectors**.
- Train models like **Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / SVM**.
- Evaluate with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.
- Save trained model using **joblib**.
- Predict spam/ham messages interactively using a script.
